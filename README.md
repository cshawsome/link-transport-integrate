This branch contains all the code to reproduced analyses, summaries, and figures in the paper

"Combining information from population-representative studies to perform algorithmic dementia classification: Bayesian modeling, workflow, and analysis"

## Data access
Analyses use data from the 2016 wave of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and two of its substudies-- the 2016 wave of the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) and the 2002 wave of the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS). 

Data from the main HRS study are publicly available. HCAP and ADAMS data are available upon completion of data use agreements. All HRS data products are linked here: https://hrs.isr.umich.edu/data-products

## Code structure
Scripts for the simulation study are in the simulation_study folder and are to be run in numerical order. <br>
The functions folder houses general purpose functions for simulation study scripts
