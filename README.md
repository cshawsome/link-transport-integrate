## Repo Structure
I've created branches for code specific to each dissertation paper vs. the entire dissertation document. Each branch contains its own README.md with details about each script included.

main: code for entire dissertation project <br>
model_method: code for paper focusing on the model and methods for this project <br>
[branch_3]: <br>
[branch_4]: <br>

## Main branch code structure
Scripts are to be run in numerical order
